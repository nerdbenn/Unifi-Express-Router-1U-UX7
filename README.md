# Unifi Express Router 1U (UX7)

This is a 1U model addition for a 10-inch mini rack. This is what I personally use to consolidate from multiple 19-inch cabinets and racks. To find that SOHO lap between clean and organised commercial cabinets and the chaos of the residential/consumer sprawl.

**UX7: Build options**
1. Single complete unit for people with a decent-sized printer (v2.1) https://github.com/nerdbenn/Unifi-Express-Router-1U-UX7/single/UX7v2.1_unifi-express-10in-rack-mount.stl
3. 3-Module units for front panel, main unit and power/cable management sections. (v3.1) https://github.com/nerdbenn/Unifi-Express-Router-1U-UX7/modular

**Key Features**

 - Modular design in 1U form factor
 - 2x Ethernet connectors are at the front of the unit, with additional supports for keystone jacks
 - Holding shelf for power supply and network cables
 - Honeycomb shelf for high air-low and minimal print materials
 - Device "UX7" LED design is visible
 - Works with existing community 10-inch designs

**Dimensions**

UniFi Express 7: over-sized to 10-inch rack height
